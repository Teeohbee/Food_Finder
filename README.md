City Pantry JS Coding Test
==========================

Tasks:

* Install the packages defined in `package.json`.
* Create a .gitignore file with any rules you feel would be appropriate.
* Edit the file `your-code.js` to use `PackagesFactory.searchPackages` to use our API to search for  
  burritos that can be delivered to the Houses of Parliament in London. That method can be found  
  here:  
  https://github.com/CityPantry/citypantry-js-lib/blob/ef71f2c577833c31cc68e2e7f9fa526e54f381a2/src/factories/PackagesFactory.js#L31
* Display photos of each of our meal packages that are returned in `index.html`.

Bonus points for:

* Writing unit tests.

Once you have finished, email amy@citypantry.com with your code either as an email attachment  
or as a link to a GitHub repository with your solution.
